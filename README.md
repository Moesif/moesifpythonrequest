## Moesif Patch Python Requests

This is a library to patch the Requests lib for capturing outgoing API calls to send to Moesif for API Analytics.

It is imported as a dependency in higher level middleware like [Moesif Django Middleware](https://github.com/moesif/moesifdjango) and [Moesif WSGI Middleware](https://github.com/moesif/moesifwsgi) which we recommend checking out first.
